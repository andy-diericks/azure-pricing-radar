# Development journal

Append-only diary of the autonomous developer. Each scheduled run adds one
entry (format in playbooks/dev-run.md). Humans read this to supervise;
Claude reads the tail of it to remember.

## 2026-07-15 — bootstrap
- Task: initial scaffold (created by the human, with Claude in claude.ai)
- Did: constitution (CLAUDE.md), playbook, workflows, data pipeline, ADRs,
  quality examples, issue templates.
- Decisions: Vite+React+TS, Recharts, GitHub Pages (ADR 0001); dark data-dense
  design system (ADR 0002); scoped fetch (VMs + Storage West Europe, OpenAI EU).
- Noticed for later: app/ does not exist yet — that's issue #1.

## 2026-07-15T18:43Z — run 2026-07-15-1836
- Task: #2 Scaffold the app/ dashboard (Vite+React+TS per ADR 0001)
- Did: Created app/ with Vite 5 + React 18 + TypeScript 5. Applied all ADR 0002
  tokens as CSS custom properties (colors, fonts, spacing, radius). Placeholder
  page shows site title, tagline, and a color-coded legend for price directions.
  Vitest + @testing-library/react included; 3 tests green. All 4 checks pass:
  lint, typecheck, test, build.
- Decisions: Used @testing-library/jest-dom/vitest entry point (not the default)
  so expect.extend() imports vitest's expect rather than a missing global.
  Created src/vitest.d.ts to make the jest-dom type augmentation available
  project-wide without polluting tsconfig types[].
- Noticed for later: Vite base path will need setting to /azure-pricing-radar/
  for GitHub Pages (issue #6 scope). Vitest 2.x deprecation warnings are harmless.
